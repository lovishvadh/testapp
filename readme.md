Test react native application

Please note:
1) Redux would have been preffered for passing data between components but for this scope of assignment have passed it using props.

2) Certain optimization techniques haven't been implemented or ignored for finishing it sooner.

3) App build settings were done only for android if needed can be done and built for ios as well.

4) App hasn't been tested on iOS. If required can do the same and resubmit.

After clone ** yarn install **

To run: 
react-native run-android

To build apk: 
cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease
